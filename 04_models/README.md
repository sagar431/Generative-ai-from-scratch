# Models

This directory contains different implementations of Language Models, from basic to advanced architectures.

## Directory Structure

- `basic_llm/`: Simple language model implementations
  - Basic neural language model
  - Character-level language model
  - Simple transformer-based model

- `gpt_style/`: GPT-style model implementations
  - Decoder-only transformer
  - Causal language modeling
  - Advanced attention patterns

- `experiments/`: Experimental model architectures
  - Model variations
  - Architecture experiments
  - Performance optimizations

## Implementation Notes

1. Each model includes detailed documentation
2. Models are implemented with PyTorch
3. Focus on clean, readable, and efficient code
4. Includes training and inference scripts
